These are my custom build instructions for a windows x64 version.

# gvim  
There is a custom gvimrc file (_gvimrc_example.jam).  
Rename this to _gvimrc and place in your home directory. It has the following basic settings:  
 * consolas font  
 * menus disabled  
 * scrollbars disabled   
 * annoying bell disabled  
 * jellybean color scheme (dark theme)
